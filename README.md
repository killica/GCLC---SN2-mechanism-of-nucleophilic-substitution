# GCLC: SN2 mechanism of nucleophilic substitution

This project provides a 3D animated visualization of a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction using GCLC. Atoms are represented as parametric spheres, and bonds are shown as curves connecting the closest points of the spheres. The animation illustrates the following:
1. Nucleophile approaching the central carbon
2. Intermediate pentavalent state of the central carbon atom and the substituents rearranging to form a tetrahedral geometry.
3. Leaving group departure.
